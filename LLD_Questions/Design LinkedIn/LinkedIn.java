/*
OO Design principles and Design patterns that can be applied to design it:
1. SRP (Single Responsibility Principle):
You should be able to think about the basic classes and their relationship.
2. Composition (Post will have a list of comments, likes)
3. Observer Pattern: to send the notifications
4. Iterator pattern: to iterate in the list of posts or followers
5. Singleton: to create only one/limited instance of Admin
